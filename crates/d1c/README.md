# d1c

**Type-safe SQL queries for Cloudflare D1 + Rust Workers**

d1c generates compile-time checked Rust functions from your SQL queries, eliminating an entire class of bugs while keeping your Worker bundles tiny. Think `sqlc` for Go, but designed specifically for Cloudflare's edge platform.

```rust
// db/queries/monitors.sql
-- name: ListMonitors :many
SELECT id, name, enabled FROM monitors WHERE org_id = :org_id;

// Generated code you get to use:
let monitors = queries::list_monitors(&d1, org_id).await?;
//                                    ^^^ type-safe, compile-time checked
```

No more positional parameter bugs. No more manual JSON parsing. No more typos in column names discovered at runtime. Just clean, fast, safe code.

> **Status:** Early development. Core codegen works, type inference is solid, but expect the CLI and query format to evolve as we learn from real-world use.

---

## Why d1c?

**If you're building on Cloudflare Workers with D1, you've probably written code like this:**

```rust
let result = d1.prepare("SELECT * FROM monitors WHERE org_id = ?1")
    .bind(&[org_id.into()])?  // positional params = footgun
    .all()
    .await?;

// Now manually parse untyped JSON...
for row in result.results {
    let id = row.get("id").ok_or("missing id")?;
    let name = row.get("name").ok_or("missing name")?;
    // repeat 10x, hope you spelled everything right
}
```

**Problems:**
- Positional parameters (`?1`, `?2`) are error-prone
- Column names are strings—typos become runtime panics
- No compile-time verification that your query matches your schema
- Manual JSON parsing is boilerplate-heavy
- Refactoring is scary (did you update all 47 queries?)

**With d1c:**

```rust
let monitors = queries::list_monitors(&d1, org_id).await?;
// That's it. Type-safe, compile-time checked, zero boilerplate.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Named parameters (`:org_id` instead of `?1`)
- ✅ Typed result structs (no manual JSON parsing)
- ✅ Compile-time schema validation (typos fail at build time)
- ✅ Tiny generated code (WASM-friendly, no runtime overhead)
- ✅ Refactoring is safe (compiler catches schema changes)

---

## How It Works

d1c treats your **Wrangler migration files** as the source of truth:

```
1. Read your db/migrations/*.sql files
   └─→ (these are the same migrations wrangler d1 migrations apply uses)

2. Replay them into a local SQLite database
   └─→ (gives us a schema that exactly matches your D1 database)

3. Read your db/queries/*.sql files
   └─→ (user-written queries with -- name: headers)

4. Generate typed Rust functions
   └─→ (compile-time checked against the schema)
```

**Key insight:** Cloudflare D1 is SQLite. By using a local SQLite database for introspection, we get 100% faithful type information without ever touching your production D1.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cargo install d1c
```

### First Time Setup
```bash
cd your-worker-project
d1c init
```

This will:
- ✅ Read your `wrangler.toml` to find migrations
- ✅ Suggest sensible paths for queries and generated code  
- ✅ Create `d1c.toml` with everything configured
- ✅ Add an example query file to get you started

Then just:
```bash
d1c gen
```

and you're ready to write type-safe queries.

### Write a query

```sql
-- db/queries/monitors.sql

-- name: GetMonitor :one
SELECT id, name, url, interval_s, enabled
FROM monitors
WHERE id = :id;

-- name: ListMonitorsByOrg :many
SELECT id, name, enabled
FROM monitors
WHERE org_id = :org_id
ORDER BY name;

-- name: CreateMonitor :one
INSERT INTO monitors (id, org_id, name, url, interval_s, enabled)
VALUES (:id, :org_id, :name, :url, :interval_s, :enabled)
RETURNING *;

-- name: UpdateMonitorEnabled :exec
UPDATE monitors
SET enabled = :enabled
WHERE id = :id;
```

### Generate code

```bash
d1c gen
```

This creates `src/db/queries.rs`:

```rust
// Auto-generated by d1c - DO NOT EDIT

use worker::D1Database;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct GetMonitorRow {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub url: String,
    pub interval_s: i64,
    pub enabled: bool,
}

pub async fn get_monitor(
    d1: &D1Database,
    id: &str,
) -> worker::Result<Option<GetMonitorRow>> {
    // ... generated implementation
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ListMonitorsByOrgRow {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub enabled: bool,
}

pub async fn list_monitors_by_org(
    d1: &D1Database,
    org_id: &str,
) -> worker::Result<Vec<ListMonitorsByOrgRow>> {
    // ... generated implementation
}

// ... more functions
```

### Use it in your Worker

```rust
use crate::db::queries;

#[worker::event(fetch)]
async fn fetch(req: Request, env: Env, _ctx: Context) -> Result<Response> {
    let d1 = env.d1("DB")?;
    
    // Type-safe, compile-time checked queries
    let monitor = queries::get_monitor(&d1, "mon_123").await?;
    let all_monitors = queries::list_monitors_by_org(&d1, "org_456").await?;
    
    // Compiler enforces correct parameters
    queries::create_monitor(
        &d1,
        "mon_789",
        "org_456",
        "API Health",
        "https://api.example.com/health",
        60,
        true,
    ).await?;
    
    Response::ok("done")
}
```

---

## Query Format

Queries use special comment headers to specify behavior:

```sql
-- name: FunctionName :cardinality
-- ^ function name    ^ :one | :many | :exec | :scalar
```

**Cardinalities:**

- `:one` – Returns `Option<Row>` (expects 0 or 1 results)
- `:many` – Returns `Vec<Row>` (any number of results)
- `:exec` – Returns nothing (for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE without RETURNING)
- `:scalar` – Returns `Option<T>` (for single-column results like `COUNT(*)`)

**Named parameters:**

Use `:param_name` in your queries:

```sql
-- name: FindUser :one
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE email = :email AND active = :active;
```

Becomes:

```rust
pub async fn find_user(
    d1: &D1Database,
    email: &str,
    active: bool,
) -> worker::Result<Option<FindUserRow>>
```

d1c rewrites named parameters to positional parameters behind the scenes, so you get the ergonomics without the runtime cost.

## Why Not Just Use...?

### sqlx?

sqlx is excellent for traditional Rust apps, but:
- ❌ Requires a runtime connection pool (doesn't fit Workers)
- ❌ Heavy macro machinery increases compile times
- ❌ Designed for long-running servers, not edge functions

d1c generates static code at build time—zero runtime overhead, perfect for WASM.

### diesel?

diesel is a full ORM:
- ❌ Large dependency tree (bloats WASM bundles)
- ❌ Schema-first (not migration-first like Wrangler requires)
- ❌ Designed for application servers, not serverless

d1c is just codegen, not an ORM. Tiny output, no runtime.

### Raw D1 bindings?

You can absolutely use `worker::D1Database` directly:
- ✅ Zero dependencies
- ❌ Positional parameters are error-prone
- ❌ Manual JSON parsing everywhere
- ❌ No compile-time safety
- ❌ Refactoring is dangerous

d1c gives you the safety without the weight.

---

## Project Philosophy

**Small scope, done well:**
- ✅ Only does codegen (doesn't run migrations)
- ✅ Only targets D1 (not a generic SQL tool)
- ✅ Only generates Rust (not a multi-language tool)

**Cloudflare-native:**
- ✅ Treats Wrangler migrations as source of truth
- ✅ Generates code for `worker::D1Database`
- ✅ Optimized for WASM bundle size

**Rust-friendly:**
- ✅ Generates idiomatic Rust (not translated Go)
- ✅ Works with standard Cargo workflows
- ✅ Committed generated code (like protobuf)

**Out of scope:**
- ❌ Not a migration runner (Wrangler owns that)
- ❌ Not an ORM (just typed queries)
- ❌ Not a remote DB tool (only introspects locally)

## Comparison to sqlc

d1c is heavily inspired by [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev), but adapted for Rust + Cloudflare:

| Feature | sqlc (Go) | d1c (Rust) |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Query syntax | `-- name:` comments | Same |
| Named params | `:param` or `@param` | `:param` only |
| Schema source | `schema.sql` or migrations | Wrangler migrations |
| Target runtime | Go stdlib `database/sql` | `worker::D1Database` |
| Bundle size | Not a concern (server binary) | Critical (WASM) |

d1c keeps the good parts (typed queries from SQL) while respecting Workers' constraints (small bundles, edge runtime, Wrangler workflow).

---

## Commands

### `d1c gen`

Generate Rust code from your queries.

```bash
d1c gen
```

Options:
- `--config <path>` – Use a different config file (default: `d1c.toml`)
- `--check` – Verify queries are valid without writing files

### `d1c dump-schema`

Export the current schema as SQL (useful for debugging).

```bash
d1c dump-schema > db/schema.sql
```

This shows you exactly what d1c sees after applying your migrations.

---

## Configuration

Create `d1c.toml` in your project root:

```toml
# Required: where your Wrangler migration files live
migrations_dir = "db/migrations"

# Required: where your query files are
queries_dir = "db/queries"

# Required: where to write generated Rust code
codegen_dir = "src/db"

# Optional: module name for generated code (default: "queries")
module_name = "queries"
```

---

## Workflow

1. **Write migrations** (just like you already do):
   ```sql
   -- db/migrations/0001_create_monitors.sql
   CREATE TABLE monitors (
     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     org_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     ...
   );
   ```

2. **Apply migrations** (via Wrangler):
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --local
   wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote
   ```

3. **Write queries**:
   ```sql
   -- db/queries/monitors.sql
   -- name: ListMonitors :many
   SELECT * FROM monitors WHERE org_id = :org_id;
   ```

4. **Generate code**:
   ```bash
   d1c gen
   ```

5. **Use in your Worker**:
   ```rust
   let monitors = queries::list_monitors(&d1, org_id).await?;
   ```

6. **Commit generated code**:
   ```bash
   git add src/db/queries.rs
   git commit -m "Update queries"
   ```

Generated code is committed just like protobuf—it's part of your source tree, not a build artifact.

## Limitations

**Current:**
- Only supports SQLite types (D1 is SQLite, so this is fine)
- No transaction helpers (use D1's batch API directly)
- No connection pooling (Workers are stateless anyway)
- Query parsing is simple (doesn't handle every SQL edge case)

**Future:**
- Better type inference for expressions
- Support for D1's upcoming features (vectors, etc.)
- Optional runtime helpers (if there's demand)

---

## Examples

See the [examples/](examples/) directory for full working demos:

- `basic/` – Simple CRUD operations
- `saavy-uptime/` – Real-world usage in a production app
- `relations/` – JOINs and foreign keys

---

## Contributing

d1c is young and opinionated. If you're building on D1 + Rust and hit rough edges, we'd love to hear about it:

- **File issues** for bugs, confusing errors, or missing features
- **Share your queries** if d1c can't handle them (helps us improve)
- **Contribute docs** for common patterns or gotchas

We're especially interested in feedback from people using D1 in production Workers.

---

## Inspiration

- **[sqlc](https://sqlc.dev)** – Proved that codegen from SQL beats ORMs for many use cases
- **Cloudflare's D1 team** – For building SQLite at the edge
- **The Rust community** – For showing that type safety doesn't have to sacrifice ergonomics
